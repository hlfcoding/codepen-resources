# CodePen Resources

:package: Styles and scripts for my CodePen sketches.

My CodePen sketches were getting large and difficult to manage. Because pre-
process sources like `.scss` and `.coffee` cannot be imported into sketches,
these resources are plain `.css` and `.js` that only target evergreen browsers
with new features mitigating the lack of pre-processors. So make sure to import
`unsupported.js` first. And to deploy: `./bin/deploy`.
